### snorkling grays channel along fort derussy beach park

surprisingly good snorkling at the southeast end of grays channel along fort derussy beach park.
the reef between grays channel and turtle canyon is great area for watching large sea turtles feeding on seaweed.
for the uninitiated and safety reasons, it's better to stay closer to the grays channel side of the reef than the turtle canyon side of the reef.
you will see surfers out past turtle canyon.
